# openscripts Arch User Repository (AUR) packages ðŸ“¦

This repository contains the packages I maintain in the Arch User Repository (AUR).

## Workflow

The workflow for maintaining packages in the AUR is as follows:

1. At midnight a Github Action runs to check for updates of the packages.
1. If there are updates, the Github Action will create a pull request with the updated packages.
1. The pull request will be reviewed and merged.
1. Another Github Action will push the updated packages to the AUR.
